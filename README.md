# Replication_Diebold_Li-2006-
I’m replicating the paper ”Forecasting the term structure of government bond yields” by
Diebold and Li (2006). The essay comes along with a detailed Jupiter notebook file that allows to
replicate all the results in the essay and the complete dataset.
I've taken the data from another replication of the paper: https://github.com/1IfByLAN2IfByC/Diebold_BondYield/tree/master
